We're building a website for Spotlight Homeschool Community Theater of West Michigan. We have the domain spotlightwm.org.

We will be building an Elixir app with Beacon CMS.

Here's info from Debbie in regards to thoughts about the site:
  - Spotlight Homeschool Community Theater is a non-profit group  created  with the intent to redeem the arts for Christ and to bring family-friendly theater to our community.

  - SHCT is  for all ages and abilities. Kids get to work on public speaking, enhancing their creative abilities and contributing to their community by providing wholesome, faith-based and family-friendly entertainment.

  -The Annual Golden Quill Award is given each year to a student who submits a 15-20-minute long script that represents the values and vision of SHCT. The recipient of the Golden Quill will be able to chose and direct a cast to perform their work in our spring productions. Submissions are due by October 15th and will be voted on by Jan 10th.


Let's create a plan, and start building!
